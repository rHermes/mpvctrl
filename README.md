# mpvctrl
Control mpv from a website

The initial usecase for this was that I would watch shows from my bed looking at a monitor
on the other side of the room. Some video files have chapters set in them, so you can skip
intros and endings. It got tiresome to get up and walk to the keyboard and press next so
I made a simple webapp which I could use on my phone.

I'm uploading this now, because I recently came across it after sorting through a backup. I
don't quite remember how to do the mpv side of things. I'll upload instructions after I rediscover
this.

At the moment it only support windows, but it is a trivial change to allow it to support linux
pipes aswell. I'll look into this too in the future, or if a feature request is made.
